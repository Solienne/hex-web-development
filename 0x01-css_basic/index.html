		<h1>Studying at Holberton School</h1>

		<p>
		Have you ever heard about Holberton School?Well, let me tell you. It is
		<br />
		a college where you can learn about technology and even get a degree for
		<br />
		free (you just need to make contributions after you get stabilished in the
		<br />
		area - to guarentee that others will have the same opportunity you did!).
		</p>

		<h2>Me at Holberton School: How it started</h2>

		<p>
		It happened suddely. I was on instagram when I saw a publication about
		<br />
		a partnership between Pearson Next and Holberton School and that they
		were
		<br />
		offering a free course for at least 100 luck folks, once they passed
		the tests, <br />
		a scholarchip to a Full Stack course. Spoiler alert: I was one of them!
		</p>

		<h3>How it is going for now</h3>

		<p>
		I have to say that these guys take education very seriously. Each one
		of the 80 <br />
		projects are very challenging, but they give us what we need to learn
		and to develop ourselves into full stackers.
